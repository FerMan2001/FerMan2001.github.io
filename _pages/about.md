One of my main goals as a CS major is to create something that will impact someone's life in a positive way. I remember playing Final Fantasy X on the PS2 as a child, and that game instilled a passion for creating something beautiful and memorable. Ever since then Iâ€™ve been trying to create that same feeling of wonder, and bestow it to someone else. This is my main goal as a programmer. I would also say that I'm a very adaptive person. Because I have a more artistic background I feel that I'm able to problem solve issues from a different perspective. This is my main goal as a programmer, to impact someone's life.
